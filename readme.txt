Employee Management System
Introduction:
The Employee Management System (EMS) is a Python-based application that offers a streamlined solution for managing employee information within an organization. Built using the Tkinter library for its graphical user interface (GUI), the EMS allows users to handle employee records effectively. Additionally, the system integrates web scraping and API functionalities to provide real-time weather updates based on the user’s location. A key feature of the system is the ability to visualize employee data, particularly based on their salaries.

Objectives:
- Develop a user-friendly interface for managing employee data.
- Implement CRUD operations for employee records.
- Incorporate web scraping to determine the user's location.
- Fetch real-time temperature data for the user’s location using a weather API.
- Visualize employee salary data using data visualization techniques.

Key Features:
1. Employee Data Management:
   - Add, update, delete, and view employee records with ease.
   - Store employee data like name, designation, department, salary, and more.
   
2. Location and Weather Integration:
   - Web scraping to determine the user's location based on their IP address.
   - API integration to fetch and display real-time temperature and weather conditions.

3. Salary Visualization:
   - Visualize employee salary distribution using graphs and charts.
   - Generate insights into salary patterns across departments, roles, etc.

Technologies Used:
- Python: The core programming language for building the application.
- Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- Beautiful Soup & Requests: Employed for web scraping to get the user’s location.
- OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather and temperature data based on the user’s location.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn:Libraries used for salary data visualization.

Implementation Overview:
- GUI Development: Create an intuitive and interactive interface using Tkinter, enabling users to navigate easily through employee records and functionalities.
- Database Integration: Store employee data in a local database (e.g., SQLite) and support all CRUD operations.
- Web Scraping: Use web scraping to detect the user's location, which is then used to fetch real-time weather data.
- Salary Visualization: Generate visual representations of employee salary data, enabling users to understand and analyze salary distributions.

Usage Instructions:
1. Run the Application: Execute the Python script to launch the EMS.
2. Manage Employee Data: Use the GUI to add, update, delete, and view employee details.
3. View Location-Based Weather Data: The application will automatically fetch and display the current temperature of the user’s location.
4. Salary Visualization: Access the salary visualization feature to view salary distributions of employees through charts.
